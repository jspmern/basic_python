# Python divides the operators in the following groups:

# Arithmetic operators
# +	  Addition	        x + y	
# -	  Subtraction	    x - y	
# *	  Multiplication	x * y	
# /	  Division	        x / y	
# %	  Modulus	        x % y
# **  Exponentiation	x ** y	
# //  Floor division	x // y  it is just like floor value 
#example-1

#print(3%2)	#1
#print(1%6)  #1
#print(0%2)  #0
#print(2%0)   #error
#print(2%-10)  # -8
#print(10//3)


# Assignment operators
# = 	x = 5	x = 5	
# +=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
# -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
# *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
# /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
# %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
# //=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
# **=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
# &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
# |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
# ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
# >>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
# <<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3	
# :=	print(x := 3)	x = 3
# print(x)



# Comparison operators
# ==	Equal	x == y	
# !=	Not equal	x != y	
# >	Greater than	x > y	
# <	Less than	x < y	
# >=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
# <=	Less than or equal to	x <= y


# Logical operators
# and 	Returns True if both statements are true	x < 5 and  x < 10	
# or	Returns True if one of the statements is true	x < 5 or x < 4	
# not	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	not(x < 5 and x < 10)


# Identity operators
# is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y



# Membership operators
# in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	
# not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y
